<h3 class="h4 mt-4">TL;DR — The short version</h3>
<p><strong>Declared Intent proposes a global standard for accountability in complex systems: make intent explicit, bind it to authority, and preserve it as systems act.</strong></p>
<p>Most system failures are not caused by missing rules, but by <em>intent that is never clearly declared, fixed, and defended at the moment action is authorised and executed</em>. Under pressure, decisions drift, authority becomes ambiguous, and accountability weakens.</p>
<p><strong>AI and automation make this gap impossible to ignore</strong> because actions scale fast and cross domains at machine speed — but the problem applies to any complex system where the power to act scales faster than the ability to explain, justify, and constrain those actions.</p>

<h3 class="h4 mt-4">Concept overview: the Declared Intent Layer</h3>
<p><strong>This is a proposal for a global standard — not a product, platform, or compliance tool.</strong> The Declared Intent Layer defines a shared, interoperable way for systems to declare intent so that authority, policy interpretation, execution, and audit all reference the same statement of purpose. It specifies <em>what must be made explicit</em>, not <em>how systems must be built</em>, allowing multiple tools, schemas, and implementations to coexist.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer is a proposed governance primitive where every action by a system (especially AI) comes with an explicit, fixed statement of intent at the moment of authorisation/execution. In current practice, intent is usually implicit — organisations deduce what a system “meant” to do after the fact by examining outcomes, logs, or emails. This creates ambiguity and erodes accountability, because intent can be argued or reconstructed differently by each stakeholder.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer introduces a formal <strong>Declared Intent Record (DIR)</strong> for each action. A DIR states: what the action is, on what object, for whose benefit, how/under what method, under what limits or constraints, and what output is expected. Crucially, the DIR is <strong>time-stamped and immutable</strong>: once an action is executed, its declared intent cannot be changed — only superseded by a new declaration for future actions.</p>
<p>In essence, this creates a single source of truth about purpose that all layers of governance (authority, policy interpretation, execution, audit) can refer back to, instead of each layer making its own assumptions.</p>
<p>Why it matters: as AI systems become more autonomous and fast-moving, they can cross multiple domains (personal data, finance, healthcare, etc.) in one chain of operations. Without a clear, shared statement of intent, accountability falls apart when something goes wrong — each party (model developer, deployer, user, regulator) can offer a different story of what was intended. The Declared Intent Layer standardises the <em>structure</em> of intent (not the content) across domains, so that every system action can answer the question: “What was this action intended to do?” in a way that is consistent and verifiable across boundaries.</p>
<p>You can compare this to coordination standards like
<strong>double-entry bookkeeping</strong> (standardising financial record structure without mandating business outcomes),
<strong>shipping containers</strong> (standardising the form factor for goods without dictating the goods themselves),
and <strong>HTML</strong> (standardising how information is structured and referenced on the web without prescribing its content or meaning).
By the same logic, a standardised intent record could bring clarity and interoperability to governance processes
without prescribing specific policies, ethics, or outcomes.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">1. The Problem Is Not a Lack of Rules</h3><p>From welfare automation and financial systems to aviation safety and AI-assisted decision-making, post-incident inquiries repeatedly find that systems behaved as designed — but without any fixed, shared declaration of what they were intended to do at the moment they acted.</p><p>The most serious failures in modern systems are rarely caused solely by technical failures. They are failures of unexamined, implicit, or changeable intent.</p><p>When harm occurs, organisations reconstruct intent after the fact using emails, policy documents, logs, model cards, and testimony.</p><p>At that point, good faith and bad faith become indistinguishable, everyone can claim they meant well, and responsibility becomes a matter of opinion.</p><p>As automation increases and AI systems begin to act across domains, organisations, and regulatory boundaries, the absence of a fixed declaration of intent becomes a systemic risk rather than a local oversight.</p><p>This is not because governance is absent.</p><p>It is because intent has no first-class form.</p><p>AI has not created this problem.</p><p>AI has exposed it.</p>

<h3 class="h4 mt-4">2. Why This Is a Global, Cross-Domain Problem</h3>
<p>Modern systems increasingly operate across domains, organisations, and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A single chain of actions may touch:</p>
<ul><li>personal data</li><li>financial decisions</li><li>healthcare information</li><li>legal obligations</li><li>public infrastructure</li></ul>
<p>Each domain applies its own rules — correctly — but intent fractures at the boundaries.</p>
<p>When something goes wrong:</p>
<ul><li>responsibility diffuses</li><li>accountability becomes adversarial</li><li>governance becomes reactive</li><li>compliance becomes duplicative and defensive</li></ul>
<p>This failure mode is not sector-specific.</p>
<p>It appears because automated systems are authorised to act without a human re-examining intent at the moment of each action, so decisions occur before intent can be questioned or responsibility assigned..</p>
<p>Without a shared way to declare intent, no amount of domain-specific regulation can fully close this gap.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">3. What Exists Today (Implicitly)</h3>
<p>Intent already exists in every system — but only implicitly.</p>
<p>Today it is scattered across:</p>
<ul><li>strategy decks and business cases</li><li>requirements documents and design decisions</li><li>policies, model cards, and risk registers</li><li>approval chains, emails, and conversations</li></ul>
<p>Each layer infers intent differently:</p>
<p>Authority infers intent from roles and permissions</p>
<p>Policy infers intent from categories and proxies</p>
<p>Execution follows configuration and code paths</p>
<p>Audit reconstructs intent from outcomes and logs</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ul><li>intent is never declared once</li><li>intent is never fixed</li><li>intent is never referenced consistently</li><li>intent drifts and is reconstructed after the fact</li></ul>
<p>This is not a governance failure.</p>
<p>It is a structural omission.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">4. Why Existing AI Governance Approaches Are Necessary — but Insufficient</h3>
<p>Recent progress in AI governance is real and important:</p>
<ul><li>documentation of intended use</li><li>model cards and system descriptions</li><li>logging and traceability</li><li>approval workflows and human-in-the-loop controls</li><li>emerging intent-attestation and intent-parsing tools</li></ul>
<p>These efforts demonstrate that explicit, structured intent is both possible and valuable. However, they operate as <em>implementations</em>, not as shared standards. Without a common, cross-domain intent primitive, such tools risk fragmenting into incompatible formats, each answering the same question — “what was this action meant to do?” — in different ways.</p>
<p>But these approaches share a limitation:</p>
<p>They treat intent as documentation or metadata — not as a binding artefact.</p>
<p>In most cases:</p>
<ul><li>intent is described about a system, not declared for each action</li><li>intent can be reinterpreted or updated after execution</li><li>different layers still infer purpose independently</li></ul>
<p>As a result, accountability still relies on reconstruction.</p>
<p>What is missing is not more policy.</p>
<p>What is missing is a shared primitive.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">5. The Diagnosis: A Missing Layer</h3>
<p>Most modern systems already operate across a familiar stack:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Authority</li>
    <li>Policy Interpretation</li>
    <li>Execution</li>
    <li>Audit / Replay</li>
</ul>
<p>These layers are regulated, staffed, and increasingly automated.</p>
<p>What does not exist is a shared, explicit representation of intent that binds them together.</p>
<p>Intent is doing critical work — but it has nowhere to live.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">6. The Proposal: The Declared Intent Layer</h3>
<p>We propose making explicit a layer that already exists implicitly:</p>
<p>the Declared Intent Layer.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer sits before authority, policy, and execution.</p>
<p>It requires that intent be:</p>
<ul><li>explicitly declared</li><li>recorded</li><li>fixed
before action occurs</li></ul>
<p>At its core is a Declared Intent Record (DIR) — a first-class artefact that is:</p>
<ul><li>human-legible</li><li>machine-parseable</li><li>time-anchored</li><li>immutable</li></ul>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer does not:</p>
<ul><li>grant permissions</li><li>determine legality</li><li>enforce policy</li><li>execute actions</li></ul>
<p>It provides the shared reference point that every other layer evaluates against.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">7. Declared Intent Records</h3>
<p>A Declared Intent Record answers, explicitly and in advance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What action is intended?</li>
    <li>On what object?</li>
    <li>For whose benefit?</li>
    <li>In what mode or role?</li>
    <li>Under what constraints?</li>
    <li>With what expected output?</li>
</ul>

<p>One illustrative structure:</p>
<pre class="intent-schema">WHAT → ON → FOR → HOW → LIMIT → OUTPUT</pre>
<p>This structure is:</p>
<ul><li>minimal</li><li>cross-domain</li><li>non-prescriptive</li></ul>
<p>Once declared, a DIR is:</p>
<ul><li>immutable (append-only)</li><li>referenceable by identifier</li><li>bindable across systems and domains</li></ul>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">8. Immutability Is Non-Negotiable</h3>
<p>If intent can be rewritten after execution, accountability collapses.</p>
<p>Immutability does not mandate a specific technology.</p>
<p>It requires a guarantee:</p>
<p>once intent is declared and action occurs, it cannot be altered — only superseded.</p>
<p>This may be achieved through append-only logs, cryptographic signing, trusted timestamping, or distributed ledgers where trust boundaries require it.</p>
<p>The requirement is immutability and temporal anchoring, not decentralisation.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">9. Why a Global Intent Standard Matters</h3>
<p>A global Declared Intent Record standard does not standardise rules, ethics, or outcomes.</p>
<p>It standardises the one question every system must answer:</p>
<p>What was this action intended to do?</p>
<p>This mirrors past coordination breakthroughs:</p>
<ul><li>double-entry bookkeeping standardised structure, not finance</li><li>shipping containers standardised form, not goods</li><li>HTTP standardised requests, not applications</li></ul>
<p>A global intent standard plays the same role for intent.</p>
<p>A Declared Intent standard enables interoperability between implementations. It allows different organisations, regulators, and tools to reason over intent without requiring shared infrastructure, shared vendors, or shared enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">10. Why Now</h3><p>Automation is scaling faster than our ability to explain or govern it after the fact.</p><p>Systems that once operated within narrow domains are now deployed across healthcare, finance, public services, education, and critical infrastructure — often as general-purpose tools adapted to high-stakes use. In these contexts, the central questions are no longer purely technical.</p><p>They are questions of intent.</p><p>As systems act with increasing autonomy and influence, debates increasingly turn on what they were meant to do: whether they were intended to inform, recommend, influence, or decide; whether safeguards were binding or aspirational; and whether harmful outcomes represent deviation or fulfilment of purpose.</p><p>Today, these questions are typically answered retrospectively.</p><p>Intent is inferred from documentation, disclaimers, interface language, or post-hoc statements — often after harm has occurred. As a result, accountability becomes narrative rather than factual, and good-faith design becomes indistinguishable from convenient reinterpretation.</p><p>Regulation is responding by demanding greater accountability, traceability, and explainability. But without a shared, durable way to declare intent before execution, these demands can only ever be met after the fact.</p><p>The gap between what systems do and what organisations can credibly say they meant is widening.</p><p>The Declared Intent Layer closes that gap at the only place it can be closed: before execution.</p>

<h3 class="h4 mt-4">11. What This Is — and Is Not</h3>
<p>This is not:</p>
<ul><li>a finished standard</li><li>a product</li><li>an enforcement regime</li></ul>
<p>It is a proposal for a missing primitive.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Minimal.</li>
    <li>Cross-domain.</li>
    <li>Non-proprietary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its purpose is not to replace existing systems —</p>
<p>but to bind them together around an explicit declaration of intent.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">12. Closing</h3>
<p>Without a durable declaration of intent,</p>
<p>authority, policy, execution, and audit each tell a different story.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer ensures they all reference the same one.</p>

<h3 class="h5">A call for critique</h3>
<p>
          This paper proposes the Declared Intent Layer as a missing primitive for accountable systems —
          particularly, but not exclusively, in AI governance. Think law, finance, public administration, healthcare.
        </p>
<p><strong>It is intentionally incomplete.</strong></p>
<p>The proposal is published with the belief that the core idea is directionally right, but it does not claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the framing is final</li>
<li>that the structure is optimal</li>
<li>that the implications are fully explored</li>
<li>or that unintended consequences have been exhausted</li>
</ul>
<p>
          It is being published early because governance primitives should not be designed behind closed doors.
        </p>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">What we are seeking</h3>
<p>Critique is explicitly welcomed from:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI developers and system architects</li>
<li>regulators and policymakers</li>
<li>standards bodies and auditors</li>
<li>legal, compliance, and risk professionals</li>
<li>researchers in governance, ethics, and systems design</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, critique is welcome on:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the Declared Intent Layer genuinely adds something missing, or merely reframes existing tools</li>
<li>where this proposal conflicts with real-world operational constraints</li>
<li>how it interacts with current regulatory frameworks (e.g. EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001)</li>
<li>potential failure modes, perverse incentives, or gaming risks</li>
<li>whether intent can be meaningfully structured without becoming performative</li>
<li>where this idea breaks down outside AI (law, finance, public administration, healthcare)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">What this is not</h3>
<p>
          This is not a product pitch, compliance framework, or finished standard.
          It is a proposal for a foundational layer that would need open critique, multi-domain testing,
          and collective refinement.
        </p>
<p>
          If this idea is flawed, it should fail in public. If it is useful, it should improve through scrutiny.
        </p>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">How to contribute</h3>
<p>Critique can be submitted via:</p>
<ul>
<li>email feedback </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Please engage with the substance of the proposal rather than assumed motives or implementations.
