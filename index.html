<h3 class="h4 mt-4">1. The Problem Is Not a Lack of Rules</h3><p>From welfare automation and financial systems to aviation safety and AI-assisted decision-making, post-incident inquiries repeatedly find that systems behaved as designed — but without any fixed, shared declaration of what they were intended to do at the moment they acted.</p><p>The most serious failures in modern systems are rarely caused solely by technical failures. They are failures of unexamined, implicit, or mutable intent.</p><p>When harm occurs, organisations reconstruct intent after the fact using emails, policy documents, logs, model cards, and testimony.</p><p>At that point, good faith and bad faith become indistinguishable, and accountability collapses into interpretation.</p><p>As automation increases and AI systems begin to act across domains, organisations, and regulatory boundaries, the absence of a fixed declaration of intent becomes a systemic risk rather than a local oversight.</p><p>This is not because governance is absent.</p><p>It is because intent has no first-class form.</p><p>AI has not created this problem.</p><p>AI has exposed it.</p>








<h3 class="h4 mt-4">2. Why This Is a Global, Cross-Domain Problem</h3>
<p>Modern systems increasingly operate across domains, organisations, and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A single chain of actions may touch:</p>
<ul><li>personal data</li><li>financial decisions</li><li>healthcare information</li><li>legal obligations</li><li>public infrastructure</li></ul>
<p>Each domain applies its own rules — correctly — but intent fractures at the boundaries.</p>
<p>When something goes wrong:</p>
<ul><li>responsibility diffuses</li><li>accountability becomes adversarial</li><li>governance becomes reactive</li><li>compliance becomes duplicative and defensive</li></ul>
<p>This failure mode is not sector-specific.</p>
<p>It appears wherever actions have consequences and systems move faster than retrospective explanation.</p>
<p>Without a shared way to declare intent, no amount of domain-specific regulation can fully close this gap.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">3. What Exists Today (Implicitly)</h3>
<p>Intent already exists in every system — but only implicitly.</p>
<p>Today it is scattered across:</p>
<ul><li>strategy decks and business cases</li><li>requirements documents and design decisions</li><li>policies, model cards, and risk registers</li><li>approval chains, emails, and conversations</li></ul>
<p>Each layer infers intent differently:</p>
<p>Each layer infers intent differently:</p>
<p>Authority infers intent from roles and permissions</p>
<p>Policy infers intent from categories and proxies</p>
<p>Execution follows configuration and code paths</p>
<p>Audit reconstructs intent from outcomes and logs</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ul><li>intent is never declared once</li><li>intent is never fixed</li><li>intent is never referenced consistently</li><li>intent drifts and is reconstructed after the fact</li></ul>
<p>This is not a governance failure.</p>
<p>It is a structural omission.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">4. Why Existing AI Governance Approaches Are Necessary — but Insufficient</h3>
<p>Recent progress in AI governance is real and important:</p>
<ul><li>documentation of intended use</li><li>model cards and system descriptions</li><li>logging and traceability</li><li>approval workflows and human-in-the-loop controls</li><li>emerging intent-attestation tools</li></ul>
<p>But these approaches share a limitation:</p>
<p>But these approaches share a limitation:</p>
<p>They treat intent as documentation or metadata — not as a binding artefact.</p>
<p>In most cases:</p>
<ul><li>intent is described about a system, not declared for each action</li><li>intent can be reinterpreted or updated after execution</li><li>different layers still infer purpose independently</li></ul>
<p>As a result, accountability still relies on reconstruction.</p>
<p>What is missing is not more policy.</p>
<p>What is missing is a shared primitive.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">5. The Diagnosis: A Missing Layer</h3>
<p>Most modern systems already operate across a familiar stack:</p>
<p>Most modern systems already operate across a familiar stack:</p>
<p>Authority</p>
<p>Policy Interpretation</p>
<p>Execution</p>
<p>Audit / Replay</p>
<p>These layers are regulated, staffed, and increasingly automated.</p>
<p>What does not exist is a shared, explicit representation of intent that binds them together.</p>
<p>Intent is doing critical work — but it has nowhere to live.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">6. The Proposal: The Declared Intent Layer</h3>
<p>We propose making explicit a layer that already exists implicitly:</p>
<p>We propose making explicit a layer that already exists implicitly:</p>
<p>the Declared Intent Layer.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer sits before authority, policy, and execution.</p>
<p>It requires that intent be:</p>
<ul><li>explicitly declared</li><li>recorded</li><li>fixed
before action occurs</li></ul>
<p>At its core is a Declared Intent Record (DIR) — a first-class artefact that is:</p>
<ul><li>human-legible</li><li>machine-parseable</li><li>time-anchored</li><li>immutable</li></ul>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer does not:</p>
<ul><li>grant permissions</li><li>determine legality</li><li>enforce policy</li><li>execute actions</li></ul>
<p>It provides the shared reference point that every other layer evaluates against.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">7. Declared Intent Records</h3>
<p>A Declared Intent Record answers, explicitly and in advance:</p>
<p>A Declared Intent Record answers, explicitly and in advance:</p>
<p>What action is intended?</p>
<p>On what object?</p>
<p>For whose benefit?</p>
<p>In what mode or role?</p>
<p>Under what constraints?</p>
<p>With what expected output?</p>
<p>One illustrative structure:</p>
<p>One illustrative structure:</p>
<p>WHAT → ON → FOR → HOW → LIMIT → OUTPUT</p>
<p>This structure is:</p>
<ul><li>minimal</li><li>cross-domain</li><li>non-prescriptive</li></ul>
<p>Once declared, a DIR is:</p>
<ul><li>immutable (append-only)</li><li>referenceable by identifier</li><li>bindable across systems and domains</li></ul>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">8. Immutability Is Non-Negotiable</h3>
<p>If intent can be rewritten after execution, accountability collapses.</p>
<p>Immutability does not mandate a specific technology.</p>
<p>It requires a guarantee:</p>
<p>It requires a guarantee:</p>
<p>once intent is declared and action occurs, it cannot be altered — only superseded.</p>
<p>This may be achieved through append-only logs, cryptographic signing, trusted timestamping, or distributed ledgers where trust boundaries require it.</p>
<p>The requirement is immutability and temporal anchoring, not decentralisation.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">9. Why a Global Intent Standard Matters</h3>
<p>A global Declared Intent Record standard does not standardise rules, ethics, or outcomes.</p>
<p>It standardises the one question every system must answer:</p>
<p>It standardises the one question every system must answer:</p>
<p>What was this action intended to do?</p>
<p>This mirrors past coordination breakthroughs:</p>
<ul><li>double-entry bookkeeping standardised structure, not finance</li><li>shipping containers standardised form, not goods</li></ul>
<p>HTTP standardised requests, not applications</p>
<p>A global intent standard plays the same role for intent.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">10. Why Now</h3><p>Automation is scaling faster than our ability to explain or govern it after the fact.</p><p>Systems that once operated within narrow domains are now deployed across healthcare, finance, public services, education, and critical infrastructure — often as general-purpose tools adapted to high-stakes use. In these contexts, the central questions are no longer purely technical.</p><p>They are questions of intent.</p><p>As systems act with increasing autonomy and influence, debates increasingly turn on what they were meant to do: whether they were intended to inform, recommend, influence, or decide; whether safeguards were binding or aspirational; and whether harmful outcomes represent deviation or fulfilment of purpose.</p><p>Today, these questions are typically answered retrospectively.</p><p>Intent is inferred from documentation, disclaimers, interface language, or post-hoc statements — often after harm has occurred. As a result, accountability becomes narrative rather than factual, and good-faith design becomes indistinguishable from convenient reinterpretation.</p><p>Regulation is responding by demanding greater accountability, traceability, and explainability. But without a shared, durable way to declare intent before execution, these demands can only ever be met after the fact.</p><p>The gap between what systems do and what organisations can credibly say they meant is widening.</p><p>The Declared Intent Layer closes that gap at the only place it can be closed: before execution.</p>








<h3 class="h4 mt-4">11. What This Is — and Is Not</h3>
<p>This is not:</p>
<ul><li>a finished standard</li><li>a product</li><li>an enforcement regime</li></ul>
<p>It is a proposal for a missing primitive.</p>
<p>Minimal.</p>
<p>Cross-domain.</p>
<p>Non-proprietary.</p>
<p>Its purpose is not to replace existing systems —</p>
<p>but to bind them together around an explicit declaration of intent.</p>
<h3 class="h4 mt-4">12. Closing</h3>
<p>Without a durable declaration of intent,</p>
<p>authority, policy, execution, and audit each tell a different story.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Layer ensures they all reference the same one.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Building a house</h3>
<p>Example 2: Building a House</p>
<p>(Same structure, different domain)</p>
<p>Scenario</p>
<p>A homeowner builds a house on a plot of land.</p>
<p>Why the Declared Intent Record Is Not Just a Building Plan</p>
<p>Before construction begins, a homeowner must declare exactly what they intend to build. In the physical world, this declaration is typically expressed through building plans, planning applications, and design documents. These artefacts already capture intent in a practical sense.</p>
<p>However, these artefacts do not function as a Declared Intent Record in the sense proposed here.</p>
<p>Building plans are not immutable. They are routinely revised, amended, and superseded as construction progresses. While this flexibility is operationally necessary, it means that there is often no single, fixed record of what was committed to at the moment permission was granted. Intent can shift without a clear historical anchor.</p>
<p>More importantly, building plans are not designed to act as a binding reference across systems or domains. Even when plans are given identifiers and linked to planning approvals or inspections, these links are local and non-standardised. They do not propagate cleanly into other systems that may have a legitimate interest in the declared intent, such as financial institutions, insurers, or regulatory bodies operating outside the planning domain.</p>
<p>As a result, different actors may rely on different versions of the “plan,” interpret intent differently, or reconstruct intent retrospectively based on outcomes rather than commitments.</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Record differs in three critical ways:</p>
<p>The Declared Intent Record differs in three critical ways:</p>
<p>Immutability</p>
<p>The DIR fixes intent at a specific moment in time. Changes to intent require the creation of a new record, rather than the modification of the original. This preserves a clear, auditable history of commitments.</p>
<p>Standardised structure</p>
<p>The DIR expresses intent in a consistent, domain-agnostic form. This allows intent to be referenced and interpreted across systems without translation or reinterpretation.</p>
<p>Cross-domain binding</p>
<p>The DIR is explicitly designed to be referenced by authority, policy, execution, and audit layers across domains. The same declared intent can be evaluated by planning authorities, building inspectors, financial institutions, insurers, and auditors, each applying their own rules but referencing the same commitment.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Declared Intent Layer does not replace building plans. It formalises the moment of commitment that plans imply, and makes that commitment durable, inspectable, and reusable beyond the boundaries of a single system or sector.</p>

<div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h3 class="h5">A call for critique</h3>
<p>
          This paper proposes the Declared Intent Layer as a missing primitive for accountable systems —
          particularly, but not exclusively, in AI governance.
        </p>
<p><strong>It is intentionally incomplete.</strong></p>
<p>The proposal is published with the belief that the core idea is directionally right, but it does not claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the framing is final</li>
<li>that the structure is optimal</li>
<li>that the implications are fully explored</li>
<li>or that unintended consequences have been exhausted</li>
</ul>
<p>
          It is being published early because governance primitives should not be designed behind closed doors.
        </p>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">What we are seeking</h3>
<p>Critique is explicitly welcomed from:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI developers and system architects</li>
<li>regulators and policymakers</li>
<li>standards bodies and auditors</li>
<li>legal, compliance, and risk professionals</li>
<li>researchers in governance, ethics, and systems design</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, critique is welcome on:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the Declared Intent Layer genuinely adds something missing, or merely reframes existing tools</li>
<li>where this proposal conflicts with real-world operational constraints</li>
<li>how it interacts with current regulatory frameworks (e.g. EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001)</li>
<li>potential failure modes, perverse incentives, or gaming risks</li>
<li>whether intent can be meaningfully structured without becoming performative</li>
<li>where this idea breaks down outside AI (law, finance, public administration, healthcare)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">What this is not</h3>
<p>
          This is not a product pitch, compliance framework, or finished standard.
          It is a proposal for a foundational layer that would need open critique, multi-domain testing,
          and collective refinement.
        </p>
<p>
          If this idea is flawed, it should fail in public. If it is useful, it should improve through scrutiny.
        </p>
<h3 class="h5 mt-4">How to contribute</h3>
<p>Critique can be submitted via:</p>
<ul>
<li>email feedback (lowest friction)</li>
<li>GitHub Issues or Pull Requests (if you prefer to comment in-line)</li>
<li>written responses or counter-proposals</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Please engage with the substance of the proposal rather than assumed motives or implementations.
